## Overview

- A macro is essentially a piece of code based on the `#define` directive
- The macros "behave" similar to normal functions with some strange syntax
- Macros are a **text processing feature** and are "expanded" and **replaced** by macro definitions
- Macros are considered outdated vis-a-vis modern programming pratices, however they can make things easier for the programmers

### Syntax

```c
#define MACRO marco_body
```
{: .nolineno }

Each `#define` line has 3 parts:

![macro definition](macro_definition.png){: width="300" height="100" }
_Macro definition: 3 components_

1. `#define` directive itself
2. the chosen abbreviation, known as a **macro name**
3. the reminder of the line is termed the **replacement list** or **body**:
   - **preprocessor replaces macro name with the macro body**

### Converntion

- **Should** use capital letters for macro function names
  - not as widespread as that of using capitals for macro constants
  - to remind the programmers to be alert to possible macro side effects
- There are **NO** spaces in the macro name, however, space can appear in the replacement string
- Macros are **not terminated by a semicolon**, however, if you add one, it means the replacement string needs one
- Macros run until the first newline following the **#**
  - limited to one line in length by default unless the **backslash operator (\\)** is used for continuation

## Macros vs. Functions

- Many tasks can be done by using a macro with arguments or by using a function
- **Macros** are **pre-processed** (by the preprocessor) which means that all the macros would be processed before the program compiles
  - **functions** are not preprocessed, they are **compiled**
- The choice between macros and functions are normally a trade off between **time and space**

### Speed

- a macro is faster than a function
  - program control must **shift to** where the function is and then **return to** the calling program (the call stack), **functions will take longer than incline code**
  - macros will be expanded as inline code (textual substitution)
- a macro that is used once in a program probably will not have any noticeable improvement in running time
  - try first to determine whether it is likely to make a significant difference  for speeding up program
- a macro inside a nested loop is a much better candidate for speed improvements
  - use the profiler to pinpoint where is the time bottleneck for the program

### Space

- a function call will allocate some data (a newly allocated stack frame)
  - macros do not have this overhead
  - macros insert code directly into the program (textual substitution)
- a macro produces inline code (a statement in the program)
  - if use the same macro 20 times, will get **20 lines** of code inserted into the program
  - use a function 20 times, will just have **1 copy** of the function statements in the program (less space used)
- **functions are preferred** over macros when writing **large chunks of code**

### Other Considerations

- macros have no type checking:

  - deal with character strings, not with actual values
  - the inputs are determined at runtime by a textural substitution

- functions have type checking:

  - type mismatch will genreate a error

- macros have some side effects and also compiler specified

- harder to debug a macro than a function:

  - a function can be stepped through by the debugger and a macro cannot
  - to debug the macro, the only way is to check its definition, with gcc, using the following command to expand all macros:

  ```bash
  gcc -E source_file.c
  ```
  {: .nolineno }

### Alternatives

- **inline functions** are the best alternative to **macros**
- inline functions can be debugged, and have type checking
- however, `inline` is only a hint, not a guaranty, whereas macros will always have their place.

## Macros

There are 2 ways of defining macros, one of which looks like a function and the other one does not:

- symbolic constants (constants represented as symbols)
- function macros (operations defined as symbols)

### Symbolic Constants

The symbolic contants define a macro and some replacement text:

- leading or trailing white space around the replacement text is discarded
- macro name is simply replaced by its replacement text

### Function Macros

The function macros look like functions.

The functions macros define a macro and some replacement text:

- the **list of identifiers** separated by **commas** appears between parentheses following the macro name
- each of these identifiers **can appear one or more times** in the substitution string
- leading or trailing white space around the replacement text is discarded

### Macros with Arguments

- a macro that contains arguments has its arguments substituted in the replacement text **when the macro is expanded**
- users should **use parentheses around each argument and around the definition** as a whole
  - ensure that the enclosed terms are grouped properly in an expression (**avoid operator precedence**)

### Examples

- **variadic macro** functions, use `__VA_ARGS__` to expand the ellipsis:

  ```c
  #define WARNING(format, ...) fprintf(stderr, format, __VA_ARGS__)
  WARNING("1 + 1 = %d\n", 2);
  ```

- DO NOT use macro to create undefined behaviors:

  ```c
  #define Square(x) (x) * (x)
  Square(++x)  // DON'T do this !!!!
  ```

- using **nested macro**:

  ```c
  #define FOO BAR
  #define BAR (12)
  ```

- expand one macro to **multiple expressions** using comma operator:

  ```c
  #define MISC(x) (puts("incrementing"), (x)++)
  ```

- macros also support **ternary operator**:

  ```c
  #define MAX(a, b) ((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))
  ```

- use to create a **for loop** (NOT RECOMMENDED, scarifies code readability):

  ```c
  #define UP_TO(i, n) for((i) = 0; (i) < (n); (i)++)
  ```

## Preprocessor Operators

The preprocessor includes the following 4 operators which can make it easier to create macros:

| Operator        | Note                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `\` (backslash) | Allows for the continuation of a macro to the next line when the macro is too long for a single line<br>A macro is allways a **single, logical line** |
| `defined`       | Used in constant expressions to determine if an identifier is defined using **\#define** |
| `#`             | Used within a macro definition causes a **replacement text token** to be converted to a string **surrounded by quotes** |
| `##`            | Performs token pasting, concatenate 2 tokens while expanding macros |

### (\\) operator

Makes multiple physical lines into one logical line, to make macro more readable:

- must be the last character on the line, immediately before pressing *Enter*
- result is seen **by the compiler** as a single, logical line

### defined() operator

Checks if a **symbolic constant** is defined or not:

- if the specified identifier is defined, the value is **true** (Non-zero), if not defined,the value is **false**
- it can be used in `#if` statement, same as `#ifdef`

### the \# operator

```c
#define str(x) #x
```

If place a `#` in front of a parameter in a macro definition:

- creates a constant string out of the macro argument when the macro is invoked
- literally inserts double quotation marked around the actual macro argument

the use case for the **str(x)** macro is as (quotes not needed):

```c
printf(str(testing\n));
```

- strings separated by white space are concatenated during preprocessing, the following statements are equivalent:

  ```c
  printf("Hello, " "World" "\n");
  printf("Hello, World\n");
  ```

- the `#` operator **MUST** be used in a **macro with arguments** because the operand of `#` refers to an argument of the macro

- the `#` operator provides a means to create a character string out of a macro argument

  - a **space** between the `#` and the parameter name is **optional**

### the \#\# operator

Creates a single token out of that argument and whatever token follows (or precedes) the `##`

- usually **both will be identifiers**, or **one will be an identifier and the other a preprocessing number**, when pasted, they make a long identifier
- 2 tokens that don't together form a valid token cannot be pasted together, e.g. cannot paste ***x*** and ***+*** in any order
- mostly useful when **one or both** of the tokens comes from a **macro argument**:
  - if either of the tokens next to an `##` is a parameter name, replaced by its actual argument before `##` executes

#### Example: unique function name

```c
// ref: https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Public/Misc/CoreMiscDefines.h
#ifdef __COUNTER__
    // Created a variable with a unique name
#define ANONYMOUS_VARIABLE( Name ) Name ## __COUNTER__
#else
    // Created a variable with a unique name.
    // Less reliable than the __COUNTER__ version.
#define ANONYMOUS_VARIABLE( Name ) Name ## __LINE__
#endif
```

#### Example: named commands

```c
struct command
{
    char* name;
    void (*function)(void);
};

// to avoid typing same string twice and make code cleaner
#define COMMAND(NAME) { #NAME, NAME ## _command }

struct command commands[] = {
    COMMAND(quit),
    COMMAND(help),
};
```

#### Example: sorting

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define DECLARE_SORT(prefix, type)                                               \
    static int _DeclareSort_ ## prefix ## _Compare(const void* a, const void* b) \
    {                                                                            \
        const type* aa;                                                          \
        const type* bb;                                                          \
        aa = a;                                                                  \
        bb = b;                                                                  \
        if(aa < bb) return -1;                                                   \
        else if(bb < aa) return 1;                                               \
        else return 0;                                                           \
    }                                                                            \
    void prefix ## _sort(type* a, int n)                                         \
    {                                                                            \
        qsort(a, n, sizeof(type), _DeclareSort_ ## prefix ## _Compare);          \
    }

#include <stdlib.h>

DECLARE_SORT(int, int);

int main()
{
    int x = 5, n = 6;
    int* a = &x;
    
    int_sort(a, n);
    return 0;
}
```

## Predefined Macros

There are usually a considerable number of standard preprocessing macros defined by the compiler (need to check the compiler's documentation)

standard C provides predefined symbolic constants:

- begin and end with 2 underscores (`__`)
- cannot be used in `#define` and `#undef` directives

| Macro      | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `__FILE__` | represents the current file name (string)                    |
| `__LINE__` | represents the current line number of the current source code (an interger constant)<br>different than the line directive `#line` |
| `__func__` | the name of any function when placed inside a function of the current file (not part of th) |
| `__DATE__` | the date of the source file was **compiled**<br>a string of the form "**Mmm dd yyyy**" as "Sep 28 2022" |
| `__TIME__` | the time the source file was **compiled**<br>a string literal of the form "**hh:mm:ss**" |
| `__STDC__` | used to indicate if the compiler supports standard C by returning the **value 1** |

### Example: \_\_FILE\_\_ and \_\_LINE\_\_

```c
FILE* pfile = fopen(filename, "rb");

if(pfile == NULL)
{
    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to open file in %s line %d\n", __FILE__, __LINE__);
    return -1
}

fclose(pfile);
```

If **fopen()** fails, there will be a message specifying the source file name and the line number within the source file where the failure occurred.

### Example: \_\_func\_\_

```c
void printFunctionName(void)
{
    printf("%s was called.\n", __func__);
}
```

This function just outputs its own name within the format string.

### Example: \_\_DATE\_\_ and \_\_TIME\_\_

```c
printf("Program last compiled at %s on %s\n", __TIME__, __DATE__);
```

This one can record time and date in the output when the program was last compiled.

### Example: \_\_STDC\_\_

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
#if (__STDC__ == 1)
    printf("Implementation is ISO-conforming.\n");
#else
    printf("Implementation is not ISO-conforming.\n");
#endif
    return 0;
}
```
