## Welcome to my notebook

It's always cool to have a personal space to note down something, and may or may not share it with the world.
Though, in most cases it can be just some mumbo-jumbos coming out of my mouth ðŸ˜¹

### Markdown

I am choosing Markdown to format my notes, because it's a light-weighted and powerful tool to use...
*(nope, because I don't really know anything about html)*

### Jekyll

This Github Page is set up with a Jekyll theme called [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). There are still a ton of things I don't quite understand about this Jekyll.
So yeah baby steps, don't rush it!

### Contact

### Page Theme

The default theme is light color, if you prefer a darker theme, try out the button down below:

<script> 
    const toggleDarkMode = document.querySelector('.js-toggle-dark-mode'); 
    jtd.addEvent(toggleDarkMode, 'click', function()
    { 
        if (jtd.getTheme() === 'dark') 
        { 
            jtd.setTheme('light'); 
            toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Preview dark color scheme'; 
        } 
        else 
        { 
            jtd.setTheme('dark'); 
            toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Return to the light side'; 
        } 
    }); 
</script>
